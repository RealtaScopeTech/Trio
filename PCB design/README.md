# PCB Design

The files used to design the PCB can be found in the KiCAD folder.

You may get issues with KiCAD not being able to find custom footprints and 3D models. We have placed all of those used within the KiCAD Extra's folder.

The "Production Files" folder contains all the files need to manufacture the PCB. It includes the Gerber files and a SMD position file and BOM file that can be used with JLCPCB to manufature a board with the SMD components included.
