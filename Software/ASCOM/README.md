# ASCOM

This ASCOM driver allows the focuser to be controlled with other ASCOM compliant software. 

It can not be used at the same time as the Windows desktop standalone app.

Dew controllers can be changed via the focusers settings menu.

Please note the driver is unsigned, Windows will therefore likely decide that it's a virus! You will need to select the option to install anyway.
