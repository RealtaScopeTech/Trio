The Arduino IDE expects the files to be in a folder with the same name as the main ".ino" file so I would suggest downloading the folder that matches your arduino board.

At this time only the Arduino Nano and it's clones are supported.

Please note your Nano may need drivers installed so Windows can opperate it's USB to serial port hardware.

A common serial chip used on Nano clones is the CH340 and drivers for this can be found in Trio/Software/Windows Drivers/
