Realta Scope Tech: Trio Focuser

# What is it?

The REALTA Trio is a device that can control dew heaters, distribute 12 volt power and is an ASCOM compatible focuser. 

# Why did you make it?

The cost of some auxiliary astronomy equipment is crazy. I had no intention of paying $100 for a device the controls dew heaters via simple pulse width modulation, another $100 on a box that connects red and black wires to distribute 12v power and $200+ on a focuser controller. The cost saving plus the potential to learn something really intrigued me and the amount of information/free tools and general advice available to help people make things really inspired me, it's just astounding how useful the internet and open source/hardware have become. 

I also wanted to design something that fitted in a neat case as other maker options had a distinct DIY finish to them, I wanted something that looked finished.
