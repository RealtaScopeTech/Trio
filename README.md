# Trio
Realta Scope Tech: Trio Focuser

# What is it?

The REALTA Trio is a kit that can make a dew heater controller, 12 volt power distributer and ASCOM compatible focuser. It needs an Arduino Nano added to make it work along with your own dew heaters, telescope etc.

# Why did you make it?

The cost of some auxiliary astronomy equipment is crazy. I had no intention of paying $100 for a device the controls dew heaters via simple pulse width modulation, another $100 on a box that connects red and black wires to distribute 12v power and $200+ on a focuser controller. The cost saving plus the potential to learn something really intrigued me and the amount of information/free tools and general advice available to help people make things really inspired me, it's just astounding how useful the internet and open source/hardware have become. 

I also wanted to design something that fitted in a neat case as other maker options had a distinct DIY finish to them, I wanted something that looked finished.

# What makes it special?

The TRIO can; 

Control 3 dew heaters

Distribute 12v power to 3 devices (3A max per attached device, 10A total including dew heaters)
